<br>	What is practice as collaboration?
<br>	How to retain a common ground
<br>	When a public forum doesn’t exist?
<br>	Do we not run the risk of splintering
<br>	To a patchwork of private understandings,
<br>	buried communications in back channels?
<br>	Or subcultural currents, masking
<br>	As any real form of community?
<br>	How can you create an open invitation
<br>	To new worlds of fractured perspectives?
<br>	But It can feel as forced as a warning,
<br>	An invitation as a dare or
<br>	An invitation as a threat....
<br>
<br>	It is not the sanctity of any object,
<br>	In an artist’s identity,
<br>	Or in any one singular viewpoint.
<br>	How do you include others
<br>	As participants rather than viewers?
<br>
<br>	The Process of trust and hesitation
<br>	Is a Relay of miscommunication
<br>	In Flashed pasts of bad parts
<br>	Not fully fleshed, We are Winging it.
<br>	Standing on fuzzy circles
<br>	Of our own making,
<br>	Unclear where bodies shape out
<br>	We cross the lines despite
<br>	The Remote instructions
<br>	carried out in a joint challenge.
<br>	Priorities are what’s essential,
<br>	Yet We shift in between like illicit losers.
<br>	We only gather more even as hoarded things
<br>	Become Pantry rehash.
<br>
<br>	We Dig into the freezer of
<br>	Abandoned ideas.
<br>	Or use modular closeness to
<br>	Lessen the gravity of any object.
<br>	Resuscitation is only partial,
<br>	Or conditional and tenuous.
<br>	Things strung together loosely and
<br>	not facing outward, not yet.
<br>	Up from the basement,
<br>	The forced distortion
<br>	Of a fake party inside only
<br>	Leads to thwarted hopes
<br>	In the restoration of festivities.
<br>
<br>	The process of trust is circular.
<br>	We die a thousand deaths
<br>	In fear of letting go.
<br>	Press the space bar once more.
<br>	Start over again, then again.
<br>	The prospect of co-operative work
<br>	In the shared game does not
<br>	Stop the fact that we each die alone.
<br>	This opens up a time disconnect, and
<br>	Any attempt to reconnect in this
<br>	Mode ends only in delays
<br>	Of harsh noise and feedback loops.
<br>	We are going backwards,
<br>	We retreat in order to cope.
<br>	Reset the garden,
<br>	turn back the clock.
<br>	It is not quite Sitting still:
<br>	We gave each other slack.
<br>
<br>	Give me the ability to represent disparate
<br>	parts of myself as a whole.
<br>	So I can present as a Disembodied voice
<br>	In a multiple point of view mode.
<br>	Give me an augmented fiction mini-map,
<br>	And Birds eye view recognition.
<br>	Give me the sense of pixel-thin walls
<br>	wrapping hidden gems to unlock secrets.
<br>	Give me an Oracle.
<br>
<br>	The Point of overreach has degraded
<br>	The space; I feel we are losing touch.
<br>	“Don’t leave the room", I said, desperate…
<br>	My Interest in monstrous hybrids remains
<br>	But only as mine, all mine.
<br>	The forced connection failed again?
<br>	Where was that breaking point?
<br>	Where did it stretch too much?
<br>	Where did it come unleashed?
<br>
<br>	It only started as a platform
<br>	for understanding, but there, there,
<br>	Can there really be listening?
<br>	In lack of real contact
<br>	Our desire to reach for another
<br>	Has us lose all understanding
<br>	of who our audience is, or what is at stake.
<br>	time limits are suspended in uncertainty.
<br>
<br>	The fluidity of our condition
<br>	lets in unfathomable scales.
<br>	Lost somewhere in the
<br>	The vast expanse between
<br>	the interval of virus micro-replication 
<br>	and the scale of geology, 
<br>	our own imposed calendars become flimsy; 
<br>	a mere theatrical fancy.
<br>	We can talk revolution, riots, unrest;
<br>	while a tiny wormhole turns us outside in
<br>	quietly, everywhere, and right here;
<br>	A mesh of Non Player Characters
<br>	Are now Agents driving our actions,
<br>	motives and desires;
<br>	with Capabilities beyond
<br>	Any undeniable biological linkage.
<br>
<br>	No longer in luxury to ignore them
<br>	We face their force limply,
<br>	We enforce formality control
<br>	We enact distance theater,
<br>	An elegant dance of radii measured
<br>	Away from inevitable parts of ourselves.
<br>	We gain the Real feeling of loss of ground,
<br>	We Embrace the float of the untethered.
<br>
<br>	Loose lips of a thousand ships;
<br>	Ruined cruises as a testament to
<br>	Whole canceled leisure product categories.
<br>	Sludge waves of too much piled on.
<br>	Too many Objects, too much content,
<br>	Shadow archives of Poisonous production.
<br>	We don’t know how to stop: 
<br>	It becomes catastrophic...
<br>	A rising presence of refusal out on the plane.
<br>

<br>	_“And I’ll try…to live defeated_
<br>	_Come and see: the good in everything_
<br>	_Outside, animals sound,_
<br>	_Come and see: the open ending”_
